== README

FOR TESTING PURPOSES:
deactivate authenticate_user! in application_controller

First commit: Scaffolding done (couldnt be commited, because it was created in offline)
Second commit: Validats added, with test failures tough (Tests have to be added, too)

Some Tests regarding the update and adding of a new Object dont work. Manual testing has
shown the functions do work.

Yet not everything is working. I hope i get basic funcionalities done till Wednesday
